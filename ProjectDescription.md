### Flick Finder - Movie Recommendation System

**Project Overview:**

"Flick Finder" is an intuitive movie recommendation system designed as a webpage to help users discover films based on their unique preferences. The system combines web scraping and content-based filtering techniques, leveraging a backend in C++ and a frontend built with React. The project focuses on delivering personalized movie suggestions while incorporating key software engineering practices such as CI/CD, testing, visualization, and other methodologies for reliability and performance.

**1. System Architecture:**

- **Frontend:**
   - The frontend is developed using React, providing an interactive user interface where users can input their movie preferences and view recommendations.
   - The user interface is designed with user experience in mind, offering responsive design and easy navigation.

- **Backend:**
   - The backend is built using C++, where the core recommendation engine resides.
   - The backend communicates with the frontend via RESTful APIs, offering endpoints for movie suggestions and user input.

- **Database:**
   - The system uses a relational database (i.e. MySQL) to store movie data and user preferences.
   - The database is optimized for efficient retrieval and updating of data.

**2. Web Scraping and Recommendation Engine:**

- **Web Scraping:**
   - The system uses a C++ library like libcurl for web scraping to gather movie data from popular websites.
   - Scraped data is parsed and stored in the database, with periodic updates to keep the recommendations current.

- **Recommendation Engine:**
   - The hybrid recommendation engine combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques.
   - Content-Based Filtering: Uses features like genres, actors, directors, and descriptions to recommend similar movies.
   - Collaborative Filtering: Includes user-based and item-based collaborative filtering to leverage similar users' preferences and similar movies.
   - The engine employs cosine similarity for comparing movies based on these features.
   - The engine is optimized for performance using multithreading and efficient data structures.

**3. Software Engineering Metrics and Testing:**

- **Metrics:**
   - **Code Quality**: Measured using static analysis tools like Cppcheck to identify potential issues.
   - **Test Coverage**: Ensures that at least 80% of the codebase is covered by unit tests, measured using tools like gcov.
   - **Performance**: Benchmarks measure the response time of key API endpoints to ensure they meet specified thresholds.
   - **Scalability**: Load testing evaluates how the system performs under high traffic, using tools like Apache JMeter.

- **Testing:**
   - **Unit Testing**: The system uses Google Test for unit testing C++ code and Jest for testing React components.
   - **Integration Testing**: The system uses TestNG to validate the interaction between the backend and frontend.
   - **End-to-End Testing**: The system uses Selenium for end-to-end testing, simulating user interactions on the webpage.

**4. CI/CD Pipeline:**

- **Continuous Integration:**
   - The project uses GitHub Actions for CI, automatically running tests and static analysis on each commit.
   - For the backend, the CI pipeline includes building the C++ backend and running unit tests with Google Test.
   - For the frontend, the CI pipeline includes running tests with Jest and building the React application for deployment.

- **Continuous Deployment:**
   - The system is automatically deployed to a staging server after successful CI tests.
   - Upon manual approval, the system is then deployed to production, ensuring smooth and reliable releases.
   - Deployment scripts are used to handle environment-specific configurations and rollbacks.

**5. Visualization and Monitoring:**

- **Visualization:**
   - The system includes dashboards using Grafana for visualizing key metrics like API response times, database performance, and user activity.
   - The frontend offers user-friendly charts and graphs to display personalized recommendations and user statistics.

- **Monitoring:**
   - The system employs Prometheus for monitoring, alerting on issues like high server load or failed requests.
   - Logs are aggregated and analyzed using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) for effective troubleshooting.

**6. Other Software Engineering Methodologies:**

- **Agile Development:**
   - The project follows Agile methodologies, with bi-weekly sprints and regular retrospectives to improve development processes.
   - User stories and tasks are tracked using Jira, ensuring clear requirements and progress tracking.

- **Code Reviews:**
   - The project mandates code reviews for all commits, using GitHub's pull request feature to ensure code quality and knowledge sharing.
   - Code review checklists ensure consistent and thorough evaluations.

- **Documentation:**
   - The system includes comprehensive documentation using Doxygen for C++ code and Storybook for React components.
   - User documentation is created with MkDocs, providing clear guidance for end-users and developers.
